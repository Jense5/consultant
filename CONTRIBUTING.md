### CONTRIBUTING

If you would like to contribute, you are welcome to do so. All information about the current version of consultant can be found on the [website](http://jense5.github.io/consultant). I will also publish a roadmap in the future, which might help you to decide to work on a specific part of the tool. Always make clear what you are going to fix by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Jense5/consultant/issues). This way we can first discuss the feature and we can make sure no one is working on the same stuff. Below is a list of tasks that I would like to fix in the near future.

#### Setup

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Jense5/consultant.git
$ cd consultant
$ yarn install
$ yarn start -- list
```

#### Tasks
- [ ] Tests
