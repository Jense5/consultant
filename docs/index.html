  <p>
    Consultant is a simple, straightforward, language-independent project kickstarter
    toolkit which makes it easy for developers to manage and customize boilerplates, based on the
    nature of their project. It handles internal boilerplate management and makes it easy to add
    dynamic structures to boilerplates.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what does this exactly mean? Consultant will help you to make sure you do not have to write
    a single line of boilerplate code anymore. You start consultant, answer some questions about
    some aspects of a specific boilerplate and you are ready to take off. Coolest thing? It is
    language independent.
  </p>

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="setup" class="page-header">Setup</h1>
  <h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
  <p>
    Since consultant is distributed via npm, you can install <code>consultant-cli</code> globally
    via the node package manager. Run the version option after installation and compare
    your version with the one on this website to make sure you are reading the correct documentation
    for your version. If you would like to remove the toolkit, make sure to also remove the
    configuration file and cache folder.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
# Install Consultant
$ npm install -g consultant-cli
$ cst --version
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight shell %}
# Remove Consultant
$ npm uninstall -g consultant-cli
$ rm -rf ~/.cst-boilerplates ~/.consultant
{% endhighlight %}
  <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    When you run consultant for the first time, it will make sure that the default configuration
    file and cache folder exist. Use the <code>HELP</code> command to get a small overview of the
    possible commands and to make sure that the configuration file exists. Afterwards, open de
    configuration file and note that there are a lot of default values. All of these will come
    clear in the sections below. Make sure that the created boilerplate cache is empty.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst help
$ vim ~/.consultant
$ ls ~/.cst-boilerplates
{% endhighlight %}
</section>


<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="usage" class="page-header">Basics</h1>

  <h2 id="basics-add">Boilerplates</h2>
  <p>
    The first step is to add some static boilerplates to consultant. A static boilerplate is a
    simple set of files that can be used as a starting point to kickstart a new project. Note that
    you can choose a boilerplate in the language of your choice. For ease of
    use we will use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate">this
    boilerplate</a>. Simply add it with the <code>ADD</code> command. The last argument is the name
    to call the installed boilerplate. In case no name is given, consultant will ask for one.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
# Install an online boilerplate
$ cst add 'https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate' 'node-lib'

# Install a local boilerplate
$ cst add . 'local-bp'
$ cst add /an/absolute/path 'local-bp'
$ cst add ../../../a/relative/path 'local-bp'
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="basics-remove">Remove</h2>
  <p>
    It would not make much sense if we could add boilerplates, but couldn't remove them. Removing a
    boilerplate can be done with the <code>REMOVE</code> command. You should also provide the
    name of the boilerplate as an extra argument. Again, if no name is provided, consultant will
    ask for one.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst remove 'node-lib'
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="basics-list">Browse</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have added some boilerplates, it should be fun to see a list of the installed
    boilerplates. Do this at any time with the <code>LIST</code> command. The names of the
    different boilerplates should be unique. This command can be very useful to verify new names in
    these scenarios.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst list
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="basics-create">Create</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we can manage our boilerplates, let's start using them. Kickstarting a new project is
    very easy with the <code>CREATE</code> command, followed by the name of the boilerplate we
    would like to use. Consultant will now craft the new app in the current working directory.
    You can also provide an extra argument to the <code>CREATE</code> command, which will be used
    as the relative path to the directory where the boilerplate should be copied to. If it does
    not exists, consultant will create it for you.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
# Manual Creation
$ mkdir scraper && cd scraper
$ cst create 'node-lib'

# Automated Creation
$ cst create 'node-lib' scraper
{% endhighlight %}
</section>


<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="customization" class="page-header">Advanced</h1>

  <h2 id="custom-basics">Defaults</h2>
  <p>
    The real value of consultant is that you can customize boilerplates at runtime. This means that
    whenever you kickstart a new project with the same boilerplate, it might be customized
    automatically based on the needs of your current project. In order to set this up, you should
    add a <code>consultantfile.js</code> to the root folder of your boilerplate. The most basic
    consultant file should look like the one below. In case you would like to follow along, you can
    check the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jense5/cst-markdown-tutorial">
    cst-markdown-tutorial</a>. This is a basic example of a customized boilerplate for consultant,
    which makes it easy to understand the configuration interface.
  </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {};
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="custom-source">Source</h2>
  <p>
    Before we proceed, you should understand the fundamental difference between a static and
    dynamic boilerplate. Whenever no configuration file is found in the root of the boilerplate,
    consultant assumes that it is a static one. This means all files from the root of the
    boilerplate will be copied when kickstarting a new project. When we have a dynamic boilerplate,
    we have to specify where the real source code of the boilerplate is located. This folder
    is called <code>boilerplate</code> in the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jense5/cst-markdown-tutorial">
    cst-markdown-tutorial</a>. You can set this to whatever you want it to be. You may decide not
    to define it, in which case the default folder is used. This is not advised because default
    folders might change from machine to machine, in which case your boilerplate might break.
  </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {
  template.useSourceFolder('boilerplate');
};
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    We will be talking a lot about the configuration files in these sections. Note that whenever
    we are talking about the <code>~/.consultant</code> file, we will refer to it as the main
    configuration file, while the <code>consultantfile.js</code> is the configuration
    file of your boilerplate. All JavaScript configuration code you will see, should be located in
    the boilerplates configuration file.
  </p>

  <h2 id="custom-vars">Variables</h2>
  <p>
    While generating a dynamic boilerplate, it is possible to present certain questions to the user
    in order to have a better understanding of the nature of the project. Consultant uses the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sboudrias/Inquirer.js">inquirer</a> module to ask
    questions to the user. Take a look at the examples from the repository to get a feel of which
    types of questions can be used. You can simply pass these questions to
    <code>template.ask()</code>. Here is an example where we ask for the name of the user.
  </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  template.useSourceFolder('boilerplate');

  template.ask([{
    type: 'input',
    name: 'name',
    message: 'Your name?',
    validate: input => input.length > 3 ? true: 'Min 4 chars required!',
  }]);

};
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    When this boilerplate is generated, the user is first asked the given list of questions.
    After the interview, all these variables are available from within the files of the specified
    source folder. Consultant uses <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/">
    Mustache</a> to render the boilerplate. Make sure to check the documentation for all possible
    syntax. An example C file might now look like the one below. Underneath, I have added a possible
    rendered file when the user answered the question with 'John Doe'.
  </p>
{% highlight c %}
/* boilerplate/main.c */
#include<stdio.h>
main() {
  {% raw %}printf("Hello, {{ name }} !");{% endraw %}
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c %}
/* main.c */
#include<stdio.h>
main() {
  printf("Hello, John Doe !");
}
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    You can do a whole lot more than just inserting variables. Everything that's possible
    with the default mustache rendering engine, is possible with consultant. I advise to take a look
    at the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jense5/cst-markdown-tutorial">
    cst-markdown-tutorial</a>, where I used negations and loops, which might help you along the way.
    There are a centillion tutorials online about mustache because it already exists for a while,
    which makes it easy to find whatever you need.
  </p>

  <h2 id="custom-delimiters">Delimiters</h2>
  <p>
    The default templating syntax of mustache is great, but sometimes you just can't use it. When
    you are creating an Angular boilerplate for example, you just can't use the double bracket
    notation for your dynamic boilerplate. That's why you can override them. It is for these cases
    that consultant has the <code>template.setStart()</code> and <code>template.setEnd()</code>
    functions. Below you can see how easy it is to override the delimiters and use adapt them for
    your project. We use the same example as the one used earlier, but we adapted the delimiters
    for now. The defaults are still the double brackets, because I feel they are the most natural
    way of creating templates.
  </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  // ...

  template.setStart('<<<');
  template.setEnd('>>>');

};
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c %}
/* boilerplate/main.c */
#include<stdio.h>
main() {
  {% raw %}printf("Hello, <<< name >>> !");{% endraw %}
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c %}
/* main.c */
#include<stdio.h>
main() {
  printf("Hello, John Doe !");
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="custom-filters">Filters</h2>
  <p>
    As you have seen before, it is possible to use if-statements and loops in the templates.
    However, often enough you would just like to not generate a file at all based on some chosen
    variable of the user. In this case, the <code>template.filter()</code> comes into play. In the
    example below, <code>extra.md</code> will only be generated if the user replied 'yes' to the
    confirmation question. The argument of the filter validation function will always be a
    dictionary with all the chosen variables of the user.
  </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  // ...

  template.ask([{
    type: 'confirm',
    name: 'extra',
    message: 'Would you like the extra file?',
    default: false,
  }]);

  template.filter('extra.md', input => input.extra)

};
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    We should also state that the order of the functions in the boilerplate configuration file does
    not matter for consultant. This is due to the delayed execution. The functions just set the
    parameters for the process. The process itself will only start when the configuration
    function is finished.
  </p>

  <h2 id="custom-hide">Secrets</h2>
  <p>
    Consultant provides a very easy way to hide files from a boilerplate generation. This can be
    useful when dealing with environment files, password files, etc. Hiding files or directories
    is as simple as calling <code>template.ignore()</code> and
    <code>template.ignoreRecursive()</code>. In the example below, we do not render the
    <code>.env</code> file or anything inside the <code>secret</code> folder. It should be clear
    that this is the same functionality as passing a function to the filter method that always
    returns true.
  </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  // ...

  template.ignore('.env');
  template.ignoreRecursive('secret');

};
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="custom-summaries">Summaries</h2>
  <p>
    You now know how to kickstart a new project with consultant.
    Consultant provides an option to add an introduction and summary to the generation process.
    This makes it possible to improve the user experience and provided feedback about certain
    parameters used in the process. You can set them with <code>template.setIntroduction()</code>
    and <code>template.setSummary()</code>. An introduction is just a string, but a summary is a
    synchronious callback that returns a string which makes it possible to use variables used
    in the setup process. The passed parameter will be a dictionary with all chosen variables of
    the user.
  </p>
{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  // ...

  template.setIntroduction('You are going to create the example markdown template!');
  template.setSummary(input => 'Done, ' + input.name + '!');

};
{% endhighlight %}

    <h4>New Examples 🤓</h4>
    <p>
      At the time of writing I am working on a couple of useful dynamic
      boilerplates for node. They should be finished in about two weeks. When they are ready,
      I will post them here. If you have some other nice examples,

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="advanced" class="page-header">Workflow</h1>
  <h2 id="help">Help</h2>
  <p>
    You can run the <code>HELP</code> command to show the most recent weblinks to the documentation
    or the issues page. It should also show some frequently asked questions to get you started
    with the consultant tool. A list of commands will also be printed, in case you forgot one!
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst help
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="batch">Batch</h2>
  <p>
    Managing a lot of boilerplates can still be an awkward amount of work. That's a fair enough
    reason for consultant to support adding multiple boilerplates at once with the
    <code>BATCH</code> command. This command asks for a json file as input, which should have
    the structure of the one below. You can list as many boilerplates as you wish, together with the
    name for consultant. In case no name, an invalid name or a duplicate name is given, consultant
    will pause the process to ask for a new one.
  </p>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "data": [{
    "url": "https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate",
    "name": "node-lib"
  }]
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst batch batch.json
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="reset">Reset</h2>
  <p>
    Being able to add a lot of boilerplates with one single command makes it easy to make backups
    of your configuration. Together with this command, I have create a simple <code>RESET</code>
    command which resets and removes all boilerplates of consultant. This makes it easy to remove
    them all and then restoring a workspace with the batch command. Consultant will ask for
    confirmation when you are about to reset. To precent this, add the hard option to the command
    arguments.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst reset --hard
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="update">Update</h2>
  <p>
    An extra advantage of using online boilerplates is that you can update all of them with one
    single command. Use <code>UPDATE</code> to make sure all of your boilerplates are updated to
    their newest versions. This is especially useful to update multiple boilerplates at once.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst update
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="verbose">Verbose</h2>
  <p>
    It might be useful to run in <code>VERBOSE</code> mode to know exactly what consultant is doing.
    The verbose option can be added to any command. It uses winston for logging and will set the
    log level to debug when the verbose option is detected.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst list --verbose
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h2>
  <p>
    The last possible command of this version of consultant is the <code>SNAPSHOT</code> command.
    This basically snapshots the current working directory and stores it as a boilerplate. This
    can be useful when you are working on a project and, when the boilerplating is finished, you
    snapshot the root of your project so you can use it again at a later point in time. This has
    the same effect as adding the current working directory.
  </p>
{% highlight shell %}
$ cst snapshot

  <p>
    Everyone is encouraged to contribute to consultant. The project is new and might become a lot
    better if everyone would add some features. I am not constantly working on this project as I
    have other stuff to do, so feel free to step in. Before you fork and start implementing a
    feature, make sure to discuss it
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jense5/consultant/issues">here</a>. That way we
    might already clear some details out about why or why not I would accept the pull request.
    Please make sure to follow some basic guidelines as shown below.

  <h2 id="semantic-vesions">Semantic Versioning</h2>
  <p>
    This repository uses <a target="_blank" href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning</a>.
    Releases are automatically released with semantic release. I release patch versions for
    bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for any breaking changes. When
    there are breaking changes, I also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that
    users learn about the upcoming changes. In case there is something wrong because of the
    automated releases, please
