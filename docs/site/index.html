  <h1 id="setup" class="page-header">Setup Guide</h1>

  <h2 id="install">Install the toolkit</h2>
  <p>
    Consultant is very easy to install and setup. By default, it will instantiate  a new
    <code>~/.consultant</code> configuration file and a <code>~/.cst-templates</code> template
    directory. I will come back to these in the configuration section. These are the only two paths
    where consultant stores it's cache and/or configuration.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
# Install consultant globally using the consultant-cli npm package
$ npm install -g consultant-cli
# Run the version command to make sure it is installed
$ cst --version
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="uninstall">Remove all traces</h2>
  <p>
    It is possible to remove the command via npm, however the cache won't be automatically removed.
    To remove all traces from your system, run the following code. Note that if you have defined
    other configuration paths (see configuration section), you should remove those.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
# Uninstall via npm
$ npm uninstall -g consultant-cli
# Remove the cache and configuration files
$ rm -rf ~./cst-templates ~/.consultant
{% endhighlight %}

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="boilerplates" class="page-header">Management</h1>

  <h2 id="addingbp">Add Boilerplate</h2>
  <p>
    The first step in using consultant is adding some static boilerplates to work with. A static
    boilerplate is a simple set of files that can be used as a starting point to kickstart a new
    project. Note that you can choose a boilerplate in the language of your choice. For ease of
    use we will use <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate">this boilerplate</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding a boilerplate to your consultant library is very easy. Just call the <code>add</code>
    command to add the given boilerplate. An extra parameter can be provided, which will be the
    name of the installed boilerplate. If this last parameter is not provided, consultant will
    ask for one.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
# Add the boilerplate as 'node-lib'
$ cst add https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate node-lib
# Consultant will ask for a name if not provided...
$ cst add https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate
Please resolve naming conflict for https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate...
How would you like to call the template?
{% endhighlight %}

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="callout-alerts-no-default">
    <h4>Local Boilerplates</h4>
    <p>
      You can also use local boilerplates to add them to consultant without them having to be in
      an online repository. In this case you can just pass the local path of the boilerplate's
      folder. All examples below are correct.
    </p>
{% highlight shell %}
# Adding local boilerplates is super easy!
$ cst add . local-bp
$ cst add /an/absolute/path local-bp
$ cst add ../../../a/relative/path local-bp
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>

  <h2 id="listingbp">List Boilerplates</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have added some boilerplates, it should be fun to see a list of the boilerplates which
    are installed. Do this at any time with the <code>list</code> command.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
# Simply use the list command to list the installed boilerplates
$ cst list
List of installed templates:
    - node-lib
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="removebp">Remove Boilerplate</h2>
  <p>
    It wouldn't make much sense if we could add boilerplates, but couldn't remove them. Removing a
    boilerplate can be done with the <code>remove</code> command. Again, if no name is provided,
    consultant will ask for one. Note that we will install the boilerplate again because we will
    need it in the following section.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
# Simply use the remove command to remove an installed boilerplate
$ cst remove node-lib
# List the boilerplates again to make sure it is removed
$ cst list
No templates installed!
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="createproject">Create Projects</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we can manage our boilerplates, let's start using them. There are two possibilities:
    you can either kickstart a new project in the current working directory or in a seperate
    (specified) directory. Either way you have to use the <code>create</code> command, which will
    load all the files and you are ready to zone.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
# Kickstart a new project in the current working directory
$ mkdir project && cd project && cst create node-lib
# Or create the folder in one command
$ cst create node-lib project
{% endhighlight %}
</section>


<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="customization" class="page-header">Customization</h1>

  <h2 id="setup-consultant">Setup Consultant</h2>
  <p>
    The real value of consultant is that you can customize boilerplates at runtime. This means that
    whenever you kickstart a new project with the same boilerplate, it might be customized
    automatically based on the needs of your current project. In order to set this up, you should
    add a <code>consultantfile.js</code> to the root folder of your boilerplate. The most basic
    consultant file should look like the one below.
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {};
{% endhighlight %}

  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <h4>Basic Markdown Example</h4>
    <p>
      In case you would like to follow along, you can check the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jense5/cst-markdown-tutorial">
      cst-markdown-tutorial</a> repository. This is a basic example of a customized boilerplate for
      consultant, which makes it easy to understand the configuration interface.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="source-path">Source Path</h2>
  <p>
    Before we proceed, you should understand the fundamental difference between a static and
    dynamic boilerplate. Whenever no configuration file is found in the root of the boilerplate,
    consultant assumes that it is a static one. This means all files from the root of the
    boilerplate will be copied when kickstarting a new project. When we have a dynamic boilerplate,
    we have to specify where the real source code of the boilerplate is located. This folder
    is called <code>boilerplate</code> in the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jense5/cst-markdown-tutorial">
    cst-markdown-tutorial</a>.
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {
  template.useSourceFolder('boilerplate');
};
{% endhighlight %}

  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <h4>No Source Specified</h4>
    <p>
      It is not mandatory to define the source folder of the boilerplate, however is it <b>strongly
      advised</b> to do so. If no source folder is specified, the default source folder from the
      main consultant configuration file will be used. Because this might differ from machine to
      machine, your dynamic boilerplate might break.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <h4>Different Configuration Files</h4>
    <p>
      We will be talking a lot about the configuration files in these sections. Note that whenever
      we are talking about the <b>~/.consultant</b> file, we will refer to it as the main
      consultant configuration file, while the <b>consultantfile.js</b> is the configuration
      file of your boilerplate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="variable-insertion">Variable Insertion</h2>
  <p>
    While generating a dynamic boilerplate, it is possible to present certain questions to the user
    in order to have a better understanding of the nature of the project. Consultant uses the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sboudrias/Inquirer.js">inquirer</a> module to ask
    questions to the user. Take a look at the examples from the repository to get a feel of which
    types of questions can be used. You can simply pass these questions to
    <code>template.ask()</code>. Here is an example where we ask for the name of the user.
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  template.useSourceFolder('boilerplate');

  template.ask([{
    type: 'input',
    name: 'name',
    message: 'Your name?',
    validate: input => input.length > 3 ? true: 'Min 4 chars required!',
  }]);

};
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    When this boilerplate will be generated, the user is first asked the given list of questions.
    After the interview, all these variables are available from within the files of the specified
    source folder. Consultant uses <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/">
    Mustache</a> to render the boilerplate. Make sure to check the documentation for all possible
    syntax. An example C file might now look like this. Underneath, I have added a possible rendered
    file when the user answered the question with 'John Doe'.
  </p>

{% highlight c %}
/* boilerplate/main.c */
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
  {% raw %}printf("Hello, {{ name }} !");{% endraw %}
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c %}
/* main.c */
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
  printf("Hello, John Doe !");
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <h4>Variable Manipulations</h4>
    <p>
      Note that you can do a whole lot more than just inserting variables. Everything that's possible
      with the default mustache rendering engine, is possible with consultant. I advise to take a look
      at the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jense5/cst-markdown-tutorial">
      cst-markdown-tutorial</a>, where I used negations and loops, which might help you along the way.
      There are a bizillion tutorials online about mustache and it already exists for a while, which
      makes it easy to find whatever you need.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="custom-delimiters">Custom Delimiters</h2>
  <p>
    The default templating syntax of mustache is great, but sometimes you just can't use it. When
    you are creating an Angular boilerplate for example, you just can't use the double bracket
    notation for your dynamic boilerplate. That's why you can override them! It is for these cases
    that consultant has the <code>template.setStart()</code> and <code>template.setEnd()</code>
    functions. Below you can see how easy it is to override the delimiters and use adapt them for
    your project.
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  // ...

  template.setStart('>>>');
  template.setEnd('<<<');

};
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c %}
/* boilerplate/main.c */
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
  {% raw %}printf("Hello, >>> name <<< !");{% endraw %}
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c %}
/* main.c */
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
  printf("Hello, John Doe !");
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="file-filters">Filtering Files</h2>
  <p>
    As you have seen before, it is possible to use if-statements and loops in the templates.
    However, often enough you would just like to not generate a file at all based on some chosen
    variable of the user. In this case, the <code>template.filter()</code> comes into play. In the
    example below, <b>extra.md</b> will only be generated if the user replied <b>yes</b> to the
    confirmation question.
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  // ...

  template.ask([{
    type: 'confirm',
    name: 'extra',
    message: 'Would you like the extra file?',
    default: false,
  }]);

  template.filter('extra.md', input => input.extra)

};
{% endhighlight %}

  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <h4>Order of Functions</h4>
    <p>
      The order of the functions in the boilerplate configuration file does not matter for
      consultant. This is due to the delayed execution of consultant: the functions just set the
      parameters for the process. The process itself will only start when the configuration
      function is executed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <h4>No Recursive Filtering</h4>
    <p>
      At the time of writing there is no recursive filter function implemented. This is planned for
      future versions. The <code>template.ignoreRecursive()</code> does already exist in this
      version though. You will encounter this in next section.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="hidden-elements">Hidden Elements</h2>
  <p>
    Consultant provides a very easy way to hide files from a boilerplate generation. This can be
    useful when dealing with environment files, password files, etc. Hiding files or directories
    is as simple as calling <code>template.ignore()</code> and
    <code>template.ignoreRecursive()</code>. In the example below, we do not render the <b>.env</b>
    file and the <b>secret</b> folder.
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  // ...

  template.ignore('.env');
  template.ignoreRecursive('secret');

};
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="summaries">Process Summaries</h2>
  <p>
    You now know how to kickstart a new project with consultant. It does not end here though.
    Consultant provides an option to add an introduction and summary to the generation process.
    This makes it possible to improve the user experience and provided feedback about certain
    parameters used in the process. You can set them with <code>template.setIntroduction()</code>
    and <code>template.setSummary()</code>. An introduction is just a string, but a summary is a
    synchronious callback that returns a string which makes it possible to use variables used
    in the setup process.
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
export default (template) => {

  // ...

  template.setIntroduction('You are going to create the example markdown template!');
  template.setSummary(input => 'Done, ' + input.name + '!');

};
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="simple-examples">Simple Examples</h2>
  <p>
    As said above, the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jense5/cst-markdown-tutorial">
    cst-markdown-tutorial</a> is a very good starting point to get to know the different
    possibilities of consultant. At the time of writing I am working on a couple of useful dynamic
    boilerplates for node. They should be finished in about two weeks. When they are ready,
    I will post them here. If you have some other nice examples,
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/PreShove">let me know!</a>

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="commands" class="page-header">Useful Commands</h1>

  <h2 id="reset">Reset all boilerplates</h2>
  <p>
    Consultant comes with a built-in <code>reset</code> command which allows you to remove all
    boilerplates at once. Adding the <code>--hard</code> option will make sure no action is
    required.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
# Remove all boilerplates
$ npm reset --hard
$ cst list
No templates installed!
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="batch">Batch Add</h2>
  <p>
    It is possible to add multiple boilerplates at once. This makes it possible to make an ideal
    setup, which is easy to install. Makes it possible to use a collection kind of sharing style.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ cst batch batch.json
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight json %}
{
  "data": [{
    "url": "link",
    "name": "name"
  }]
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="verbose">Verbose Mode</h2>
  <p>
    You can add <code>--verbose</code> at any time for debug log.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ cst list --verbose
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="help">Help Command</h2>
  <p>
    You can run <code>help</code> and it will show FAQ and links.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ cst help
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="snapshot">Snapshot Command</h2>
  <p>
    You can run <code>snapshot</code> and it will snapshot the current directory and store it as
    a boilerplate. Is the same as <code>cst add .</code>.
  </p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ cst snapshot
{% endhighlight %}
