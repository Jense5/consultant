## Boilerplates

### What is a boilerplate?

Whenever you are writing code while thinking 'damn, I have done this before', you are probably just writing boilerplate code. It means that it is some basic code, almost independent of your project, which you will need to write again in the future for some other project.

If you have some experience with [NodeJS](), than you probably know that you need an awful amount of boilerplate code. I.e. setting up [Babel](), [Flow](), [ESLint](), [MongoDB](), [ExpressJS]() ... You have to do it all over and over again, for every project that needs it.

That's why boilerplates are pretty popular these days. You find a lot of starter projects on Github, like [this](), [this]() or [this]() one.
